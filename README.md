# am3tool
Tool for working with am3 Advance Movie files

Takes a am3 Advance Movie card disk image file (generated by `dd` or similar tools), removes card-specific information, extracts the files from the FAT12 filesystem, and then creates a nice template no-intro post.

## Requirements
Python 3.6+

## Usage
```
python main.py [-h] file

am3tool v0.1: Tool to assist in preserving am3 Advance Movie cards and content

positional arguments:
  file        the raw am3 card dump

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit````
  
  ## Output
  The original image file will be backed up in the same directory as `[file].original`
  `[file]` is now the generalized version of the card dump.
  A folder named `out` will be created in the same directory as the image file that contains 
  1. The `*.AM3` files
  2. `dump_info.txt` which contains the template No Intro submission post and file hashes
